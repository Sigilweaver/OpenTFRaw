# OpenTFRaw Validation Corpus

The test corpus covers every major Thermo RAW format variant the parser
needs to handle:

- All supported format versions (8, 47, 57, 60, 62, 63, 64, 66)
- Both scan-data encodings (PacketHeader and the two Flat variants)
- Each major instrument family (ion trap, Orbitrap hybrid, Q-Orbitrap,
  Tribrid, single-stage Orbitrap, Astral, triple quadrupole)

Current size: ~124 GB across 283 files, covering all instrument families
and acquisition modes.  Multiple files per instrument are included to
exercise parameter variation across real-world datasets.

## Source: PRIDE Archive

All files come from the EBI PRIDE Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/),
a public proteomics repository hosting hundreds of thousands of Thermo RAW
files contributed by academic and commercial labs.

Access is via HTTPS from the PRIDE FTP mirror:

    https://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/YYYY/MM/\<PXD_ACCESSION\>/

PRIDE datasets are published under CC-BY or equivalent open licences.

## Source List

The file `scripts/sources.json` records which PRIDE projects and files to
download:

    [
      {
        "instrument": "LCQ Classic",
        "accession": "PXD044152",
        "files": ["Ex250122_K50ng_60m2.raw"],
        "count": 6
      },
      {
        "instrument": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos",
        "mode": "DIA",
        "accession": "PXD031322",
        "files": ["OFL001513-YLL-GPF-15K-1.raw"],
        "count": 5
      },
      ...
    ]

- `files` - specific filenames always downloaded first
- `count` - total target file count from this project; the fetcher
  auto-fills from the FTP directory listing until the count is reached
- `mode` - distinguishes multiple entries for the same instrument
  covering different acquisition modes (DIA, EThcD, PRM, MS3, etc.)

To add or replace an entry, edit `sources.json` directly and re-run the
fetcher.  The manifest (`corpus/manifest.json`) records what is
currently on disk; the fetcher skips any key already present there.

## Running the Fetcher

    python scripts/fetch_corpus.py             # download missing files
    python scripts/fetch_corpus.py --dry-run   # report without downloading
    python scripts/fetch_corpus.py --list-files PXD032800  # discover files

The script resolves each download URL through the PRIDE REST API
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/v2/files/byProject) and saves
files as `{accession}_{instrument_label}_{original_filename}` under
`corpus/`.  If the API returns an empty response (an intermittent server
behaviour observed in 2026), the script falls back to constructing the
FTP URL directly from the project publication date.

To discover all available files in a PRIDE project before adding it to
`sources.json`:

    python scripts/fetch_corpus.py --list-files PXD032800

## Provenance Record

`corpus/manifest.json` records which PRIDE project each local
file came from.  Keys are `{accession}/{original_filename}`:

    {
      "PXD055201/20170427_CO_0673AnGS_DM_Mix1_R12R13R14_2.raw": {
        "instrument": "LTQ Orbitrap XL",
        "dest_filename": "PXD055201_LTQ_Orbitrap_XL_20170427_..._2.raw",
        "size_bytes": 396954554
      },
      ...
    }

## Target Instruments and Acquisition Modes

The corpus is organised in two tiers:

**Tier 1 - one file per instrument line** (covers every format version
and scan-data encoding path):

| Family                    | Instruments                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ion traps (LCQ/LTQ)       | LCQ Classic, LTQ, LTQ XL, LTQ Velos, LTQ FT                  |
| LTQ Orbitrap hybrids      | LTQ Orbitrap, XL, XL ETD, Velos, Velos Pro, Elite             |
| Q-Orbitrap                | Q Exactive, Plus, HF, HF-X, UHMR                              |
| Tribrid Orbitrap          | Fusion, Fusion Lumos, Eclipse, Ascend                         |
| Single-stage Orbitrap     | Exploris 120, 240, 480, Astral (DIA)                          |
| Triple quadrupole         | TSQ Vantage, Quantiva, Altis                                  |

**Tier 2 - additional files per instrument covering distinct modes**:

| Entry                            | Mode   | What it exercises                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (DIA)      | DIA    | Multiple isolation windows per scan cycle  |
| Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (MS3)      | MS3    | Three-stage fragmentation / XL-MS workflow |
| Orbitrap Eclipse (EThcD)         | EThcD  | Electron-transfer + supplemental HCD       |
| Q Exactive HF (DIA)              | DIA    | Fixed-window SWATH-like DIA on Q Exactive  |
| Orbitrap Exploris 480 (DDA-2)    | DDA    | Second firmware vintage for regression     |
| TSQ Altis (SRM-2)                | SRM-2  | Second SRM file from a different dataset   |
| Q Exactive HF-X (PRM)            | PRM    | Parallel reaction monitoring: 42 targets,  |
|                                  |        | 7-minute gradient, SARS-CoV-2 peptides     |

### Multi-controller coverage

Several Tier 1 files carry `controller_count > 1` in their
`RawFileInfoPreamble`, meaning the RAW file contains a UV/analog chromatogram
channel alongside the MS data stream.  The parser exercises the
multi-controller selection path (reader.rs `select_ms_run_header`) for these:

| File (Tier 1 instrument)  | `controller_count` | Confirmed year |
| ------------------------- | :----------------: | -------------- |
| Orbitrap Fusion           | 2                  | 2016-12        |
| Orbitrap Fusion Lumos     | 2                  | 2016-03        |
| LTQ Orbitrap (PXD069348)  | 3                  | 2014-02        |

The selection heuristic — `ntrailer > 0` (v64+) or `nsegs > 0 && first_scan
<= last_scan` (v63) — correctly identifies the MS controller in every case.

## Limitations

- PRIDE's metadata lists declared instrument names; a few submitters
  mislabel files.  Device detection in the parser is therefore best-effort.
- Some instrument lines (Astral, top-down ETD workflows) have few publicly
  available files on PRIDE.  The `count` values in `sources.json` are
  capped at the number of files actually present in the FTP directory.
